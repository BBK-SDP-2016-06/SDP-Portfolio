a) The Facade Design Pattern involves creating a simplified interface that hides a complex system from the client,
   performing many additional sub-tasks behind the scenes. In general, the pattern provides a single interface as a
   representation of a set of interfaces within a program.

b) The Facade Design Pattern gets implemented when an interface is required to provide access to a complex system
   of interfaces or classes, and when dependencies exist between system implementations and clients. The pattern
   provides us with a useful tool in code refactoring as it simplifies complicated relationships into a manageable
   interface, as well as providing a natural layering / hierarchy of classes and subclasses. In essence, the facade
   is aptly named as it defined a higher level interface that makes the system easier to use. In principle,
   new and adaptive implementations within the subclasses should not affect the facade.
