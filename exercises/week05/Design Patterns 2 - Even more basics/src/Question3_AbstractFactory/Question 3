The abstract factory design pattern can be used when:
    - The creation of concrete objects should be independent of the program that uses them.
    - A program uses multiple families of objects, and these in turn are used together.
    - Libraries are to be used without the need to expose implementation details.
    - Concrete classes should be decoupled from clients.
