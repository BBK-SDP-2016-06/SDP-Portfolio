a) The strategy design pattern is used to define a set of algorithms that are encapsulated and can be swapped to carry
   out a specific behaviour. This makes them interchangeable and enables the algorithms to vary independently from
   the main program.

b) This pattern can be used when:
    - the only apparent difference between a set of related classes is their behaviour.
    - An algorithm is required that has multiple variations.
    - Algorithms access or utilize data that a calling code shouldn't be exposed to.
    - The behaviour of a class gets defined at runtime.
    - Multiple conditional statements are present (can be hard to maintain / change)
