"In general, the details of object construction, such as instantiating and initialising the components that comprise
the object, are kept within the object, often as part of its constructor."

The above statement holds true and is suitable for objects that are simple to create and the construction process
always follows a definite number of steps. However, in order to create a complex object that can be implemented in
different ways using different algorithms requires multiple constructors within its class (construction bloat). Due to
the containment of all construction processes, the object does not only suffer from construction bloat, but also
becomes less modular (less standardised and more complex to arrange, understand, and maintain).
