The Bridge Design Pattern should be used when the designer foresees that there will be variations and changes made
to both the implementing classes and the abstractions. Two hierarchies are created; one for the abstraction and one
for the implementation and the join relationship between their respective parent classes are referred to as the
'bridge'. This decouples the implementation so each hierarchy can be extended / changed independently from the other.
According to Freeman & Robson (2014), this pattern is particularly useful in graphics and windowing systems that
require to perform over multiple platforms.
